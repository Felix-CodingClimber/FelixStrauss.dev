aboutText: "I'm a software developer with a passion for .NET and C#. By day, I build web and Windows applications at work, and by night, I explore various side projects including game development and graphics programming. I love experimenting with new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what I can create. When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the climbing gym or on the rocks. This site is my digital notebook—a place where I share insights, solutions, and lessons learned from both my professional work and personal projects. If it helps you (or future me) solve a problem, then it's served its purpose."
